  I replicated Phase 10, a decently in-depth card game, in Unity. 
  There are 4 players total, with simple AI controlling the 3 players that aren’t you. Scroll down on the link for instructions. It takes a few seconds to load.

Note: AI was partially used in this project. I used it to find bugs faster and fix them; and also used it to generate some code which I made sure worked. This was almost solely when programming the AI opponents.

Some features that weren't necessary like the wild card were cut.
