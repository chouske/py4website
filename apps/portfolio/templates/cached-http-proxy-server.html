This assignment was an http proxy server with a cache. Requests don't need to be fully processed if the requested data is already wtihin the cache. The cache can be managed using fifo or lru as a command line argument.
I had to use ai to fix a small valgrind error caused by some very complicated program inputs being hard to process
